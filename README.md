## **DO you Destiny PRO**
Searching application for Destiny 2 player. It presents basic statistics of a given player.

#### Motivation

Bungie.net allows users to create fireteams. Sometimes we can't determine the skill of the player who joins our team. That's why I decided to create an application that allows you to quickly check the player's general skills and statistics.
